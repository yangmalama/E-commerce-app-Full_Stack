- In early days JS was used in frontend only as scripting lanaguage for the browser. 
- In this period, JS was not aupported in the server so python, JAVA, php were used as backend.
- Later on, concept of nodeJS was introducded as a runtime for JS on the server side. Now the runtime(nodejs) is responsible for executing the JS  code on the server side.
- NodeJS is the runtime prototype(protocol)library which is complex and has a lot of feature. Then expressJS was introduced as the Framework instead of core nodeJS.

Steps to create backend server
1. Create a backend folder and go inside it 
2. npm init -y4
3. npm i express
4. npm i mongoose
5. add  "type":"module" at package.json
npm i -g nodemon
6. npm i nodemon keeps the server running after changes(nodemon server.js)

API(Application Programming Interface)
- It serves as a bridge between frontend and datbase. 
- API/End point/backendserver

MongoDB
- MongoDB is NoSQL datbase.
- It stores data on the form of documents and collection.
- Backend cannot talk to database directly, its should use mongoose to talk to the database.
